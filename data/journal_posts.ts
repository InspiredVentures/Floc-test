        "content": "<p>BorneoNepalBhutanUganda and RwandaCambodiaTanzaniaAbout</p>\n\n<p>I know that many members of the EVA Community are very seasoned travellers so my recent stint may not seem like much to everyone. But I’ve been away from home now since the middle of August and while there’s been so much excitement, you do long for a hot bath and a walk with the dogs occasionally. Actually I said I would mention the girls at Hunt Solicitors while I was away, so hello everyone. I think though that I have definitely left work this time!</p>\n\n<p>So where can I start? I’ve been to Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Morocco, Tanzania again and finally Namibia. I set up a tour for Rwanda-Uganda that includes gorilla and chimp tracking and the places are filling up nicely so far, so both trips in February are likely to fill. I’ll be on both of those, so that’s exciting. Rwanda was a revelation for me- so clean, organised and forward looking. I’m well aware that there are other serious issues at play in Rwanda with the leadership but if I’ve learned one thing over the past few months is that Africa is intensely complicated and there are layers upon layers of factors in everything. So I look at Rwanda with the eyes of a tourist who wants to give back to a developing nation that is still recovering from a genocide.</p>\n\n<p>From there it was onwards to Tanzania where there were some tweaks to be made to the tour. That’s okay though- we are a community and all of the feedback is actively sought out and acted upon. We’ll move to a more suitable hotel in Moshi for our days there from February. In October the tour will undergo quite an overhaul as prompted by the groups that were there. We’ll extend it by 2 days so that we have an extra day volunteering and an extra day on safari. There might be rhinos involved in the extra safari so keep an eye out for those details.</p>\n\n<p>Ethiopia was next on the list and that turned out to be an adventure and a half. Rough roads, long jeep rides, crushing my finger in the door of said jeep and hitting the mud inelegantly like one of the hippos. And all of that was before I slept in the mud hut on a mattress on the floor and peed in a hand basin in the middle of the night in the middle of the room. If ever there was a case of needs must, this was it. I am having a real internal debate about doing a tour in Ethiopia. The need is real, that’s for sure, but the Gurage Tribe need more than a coat of paint and a few schoolbooks. They don’t have running water, electricity, transport or adequate cooking facilities. And it’s not like they don’t know what they are missing- the village elders would do anything for a touch of progress in the village. The most touching part of my tour was when I said goodbye to the elders. They said that even if we don’t come back as a group, they were so happy that I came to see them. They have nothing in our material sense, but they had gone out and put together a bouquet of rosemary and presented it to me as a parting gift. I don’t know the right way to proceed here but we’ll talk about it and see what the next steps can be.</p>\n\n<p>On from there in a middle seat in economy class to Morocco for many, many hours. Hey, I survived. My sciatica had been helped enormously from sleeping on the floor in Gurage so I was in excellent shape for that flight via Doha. You can’t fly direct over parts of Africa because you&#x27;re flying over some dodgy areas but sure that’s all part of the adventure too. As was the fact Doha had been bombed the night before I arrived but all was quiet. There were 2 very important looking Sheiks on my flight so I figured we were safe enough.</p>\n\n<p>Any account of Morocco would be incomplete without mentioning the amazing group of people I travelled with. It was another tweaking trip and while there were definitely a few little areas to improve on, the group took everything with enormous good humour and gusto. It was one of my favourite travel groups so far (It’s okay Northern Ireland, you’re still up there) and restored my belief that what we are doing can be fantastic if you come with an open heart and open mind. Nothing was too difficult, too far, too hard or too weird for this group. We renovated a classroom that had been damaged by the 2023 earthquake and celebrated with the mothers and children in the school before we left. That was an especially moving ceremony- terribly shy, veiled Islamic women feeding their incredibly delicious cakes to hot and sweaty westerners who gave of their time and resources to fix the school. We rode camels in the sunset, played cards, did synchronised swimming and had the most amazing time. The add-on was incredible too, a true deep dive into the culture and ancient history of Morocco. Even though it was my</p>\n\n<p>4th time to visit- Fes, Meknes and Volubilis were unimagined delights that I saw for the first time this time. It&#x27;s a really great add-on and if you want to get &#x27;under the skin&#x27; of Morocco this tour is a must.</p>\n\n<p>And finally Namibia. I had no preconceptions, I had done no research and I arrived as a blank slate. Actually more than blank as my luggage hadn’t arrived so smelly and blank I guess. There aren’t enough words to do any kind of justice to Namibia. It’s vast- I mean its beyond vast. I grew up on a small farm in Ireland, it was about 15 acres while a small farm in Namibia is 15,000 acres. It hurts even trying to imagine that. We stayed on a farm that was about 40,000 acres where black and white rhinos are protected. We come back again to the layers of complexity in Africa when we start to talk about conservation. It’s a complex area and while we have some ideas from our western world about how things should work, you really need to go to see and understand the reality of the human wildlife conflict and the challenges of conservation. But that’s a definite trip and will include a visit to Botswana and the Delta. The main thrust of the tour will be conservation volunteering with Salmon Vermaak from Namibia Wildlife Protection and the Black Rhino Protection NGO but there will be more details of that before we launch the tour. Hopefully that will kick off in May,  which is meant to be the best month to visit and I hope the itinerary will be available by the end of November,</p>\n\n<p>So that’s my round up of Africa. Vast, complicated, enchanting, haunting, progressive in parts while ancient in others. They say you leave a piece of your heart behind every time. I just know I need to go back just to be sure. But for now it&#x27;s on to the last part of my journey and I will be in Borneo tomorrow afternoon to review our tour there so the excitement continues.</p>\n\n<p>LikeReplyTinaOct 10, 2025As you know I adore Africa, its land, its people, its vast abundance of wildlife. Your outlined re cap of each country you visited is a testament that each one needs an injection of our help. Etheopia hopefully will work. One thing for sure Sheila, I am immensely proud of you! Your hard graft, huge amount of dedicated time, money & effort will see the greatest of success for EVA and gratitude for all that’s gained from the ‘give back’.</p>\n\n<p>LikeReplyDebFOct 09, 2025I love Africa. Enjoyed your recap of tour trips. Your story about Ethiopia really touched my heart.</p>"

Air Kenya offered me an upgrade to Business class in exchange for my points so I took it and looked forward to shorter queues and a seat in the Lounge.</p>\n\n<p>Once on the plane I was seated alone in Row 2 until just before takeoff when a man bustled into the seat beside me. I smiled but he grimaced so I figured I’d get an hour of silence. However as the plane reached the altitude where the seatbelt sign is turned off he turned to me and asked if I was going to climb Mount Kilimanjaro. My internal reaction was &#x27;dude, do I look like I could climb Mount Kilimanjaro?&#x27; but I silenced that voice and answered that I was going to Moshi. He didn&#x27;t know where that was so I told him it was about half an hour this side of Arusha. He was going to Arusha he said, but asked what I was going to Moshi for.</p>\n\n<p>You only ever have to ask once so I gave him chapter and verse about the EVA Community, the work we do in Moshi and other places and the joys of give back travel. In the spirit of fairness I asked why he was going to Arusha. &#x27;I am the Somali Foreign Minister&#x27; he replied. Now I&#x27;m not often struck dumb but I definitely had to think of a mature and intelligent reply. &#x27;Do you still have a problem with the pirates&#x27; was the best I could manage. That was under control now, I would be happy to hear. In the on-going quest to sound sensible I asked him what the biggest problem facing Somalia was at this point in time.</p>\n\n<p>And this is where it went slightly sideways. I heard him say that the main challenge in Somalia was tourism and of course I jumped on it. I saw endless opportunities for give-back adventures in this developing country so naturally I immediately offered our full support and assistance. We could meet the Minister in charge, see if there were wildlife sanctuaries, orphanages- the list was endless. The Foreign Minister coughed (choked?) just a little, turned to me with a bewildered look and said- &#x27;You would like to help us with our terrorism?&#x27;  I was never so glad for a short flight and the chance to escape and recover just a little! Tourism/ Terrorism- easy enough mistake to make surely?</p>\n\n<p>Ethiopia itself was a fascinating country and experience. Prior to covid, it was becoming the most popular African destination and they are proud of the fact that they offer a full range of experiences and landscapes. There are parts of the country that can&#x27;t be visited right now, but I saw enough in my 4 days to know that this would be a great place to go.</p>\n\n<p>I visited the Gurage Tribe located about 4 hours southwest of Addis. Now before I write any more, I want you to know that I am just recounting my experience here in rainy season and that any tour we organise will be authentic but maybe not quite as authentic as mine. The drive was pretty uneventful while we had roads, but that didn&#x27;t last the whole way and part of the drive was on rocks. The village was about 15 minutes walk from where we parked and as it was raining it was slippy and very slidey. I had a couple of tiny mishaps including crushing my finger in the door of the jeep and falling face down into the mud.</p>\n\n<p>But we had arrived and I declined the offer of a 3-hour walk. I was ready for a nap although that didn&#x27;t happen. The guest house is very basic with plastic sheeting on the floors with mattresses in the corner. There&#x27;s a couch, filtered water and sleeping bags supplied. But that&#x27;s more or less it. There&#x27;s a long drop toilet outside but overnight there are &#x27;arrangements&#x27; made.</p>\n\n<p>It was quite an experience for me, sitting on the floor feasting on food cooked over an open fire with my fingers. And the food was surprisingly delicious and very different to anything I have eaten before. We ate a lot of curd, cabbage and eggs cooked in a variety of ways.</p>\n\n<p>The bread that is used is made from the false banana tree. This tree is vital to life in Gurage- they use the leaves to cover food and cook with it, the fibres from the trunk are stripped off and woven into mats and the pulp inside the tree is buried, curdled and used to make that bread.</p>\n\n<p>If we decide to do a tour of Ethiopia it won&#x27;t just be based in Gurage. Before covid this country was one of the most visited in all of Africa and its easy to see why. We would stay a few days in Addis, visit Bale National Park for game drives and stay in a Lodge. We&#x27;ll visit artist studios and women&#x27;s cooperatives. But we will return to the Gurage people because maybe more than anywhere else I&#x27;ve been so far, they deserve a helping hand.</p>\n\n<p>LikeReplyKcantu Sep 18, 2025So did you help w tourism or terrorism Sheila?!

I feel like I&#x27;ve been doing this for at least 100 years, but today marks one year since we first took at tour group to Morocco. And here we are in Marrakech one year later doing what was originally planned to be the last tour. And oh my goodness me, what a year it has been.</p>\n\n<p>So the first tour to Morocco was a steep learning curve for me. The girls who travelled on that tour nearly all tell me how much they enjoyed it but it was quite the adventure. We were in the Sahara Desert for a once in a lifetime flood where we thought our Riad was going to be washed away- literally. We saw grass growing in the sand dunes and while I think my reports of seagulls was possibly a slight exaggeration, there were definitely new species in the area of the floods. We had spent the previous evening making desert bread in the parched heat and woke to a Lake in place of sand.</p>\n\n<p>But floods aside, I&#x27;ve learned a lot in a year. Most of my regular readers will know that I did not intentionally set out on this journey but once the wheels were in motion I didn&#x27;t feel I had much choice but to carry on. The truth is that EVA is not one person, it&#x27;s this amazing community of people from all parts of the world who believe in contributing to communities in need in a small way while also learning more about the culture of the country and having an immersive authentic experience.</p>\n\n<p>I&#x27;ve become more clear over these 12 months about what we should look like. The two most important elements are the give-back projects and the EVA community. In terms of the projects, I have travelled far and wide over the last year meeting people who would like us to support them. When making that decision, I take into account the benefit to the wider community or wildlife project and look at how any money we donate will be protected and used. By and large, I try to work with small established NGO&#x27;s so that we can monitor the accounts. We&#x27;re pretty far down the road now of the EVA Travel Foundation so that donations made from your tour fee can be visibly seen to be helping those projects. And in a larger sense I want to have a broad range of opportunities so that we aren&#x27;t just doing the same thing over and over.</p>\n\n<p>In Northern Ireland we had a really wonderful time, but along with the fun and the history we helped a remote island community restore a greenhouse to ensure they had access to fresh produce when the storms come and they are cut off for days from the mainland. We were also privileged to watch the &#x27;jumplings&#x27;- baby birds being given a hard life lesson after getting shoved off a cliff to sink or swim in the ferocious wild north Atlantic. We believe most or all of them swam!</p>\n\n<p>Our trip to Uganda resulted in one of our members Anita Rackerby building a school on the side of a mountain in the dense Bwindi forest. The children there had no school and when we were there in February, Anita followed the sounds of their singing and found them sitting at the back of the church as they didn&#x27;t have a school. She&#x27;s an amazing member of the EVA community and if they needed a school Anita and her friends in California made sure they got one. We returned in August for the opening of the school and it was a humbling experience. And that wasn&#x27;t just the chicken I bought at the auction- we were reminded again of how lucky we are. On that trip we hiked in our best clobber to the top of a mountain to visit a tribe of Batwa, delivering 34 football strips donated by KitAid. If you see a pygmy in an Aston Villa strip in Uganda, you&#x27;ll know who brought it there.</p>\n\n<p>By the end of this year we&#x27;ll have done our second tour of Morocco, 3 trips to Tanzania and our first trip to Cambodia and Laos. In 2026 EVA will add Borneo, Nepal, Rwanda/Uganda/Gorillas, Ethiopia and Namibia. It&#x27;s an overused word, but it really is exciting.</p>\n\n<p>But none of this is possible without the amazing EVA community. You know what it means to undertake a give-back trip. It&#x27;s not 5 star travel and some of you have been to places where the only stars were in the sky. We are privileged to be invited into homes and communities- often where it hasn&#x27;t happened before. You are unfailingly respectful and unassuming. I won&#x27;t say non-complaining because lets face it we&#x27;re human, but taking all the privations in good spirit for the most part.</p>\n\n<p>So as I sit in here in a sweltering Marrackech with a group of 10 truly delightful people, I am thankful to all of you in the EVA community for not just continuing with give back travel but for putting your trust in me to bring you to this point. We&#x27;ve come a long way and I know in my heart that we will continue to bring light and hope to some dark places in the world.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#x27;s to what has been an amazing 12 months and here&#x27;s to many more</p>\n\n<p>LikeReplyCynthia Sep 16, 2025We are thankful for YOU. Many of us are hungry for the meaningful adventure that EVA provides.</p>\n\n<p>LikeReplyHazel Sep 16, 2025Very inspiring! I&#x27;m looking forward to signing up to one of the exciting trips in 2026!</p>\n\n<p>LikeReplyLisaSep 16, 2025You- and this- are amazing.</p>"

        "content": "<p>BorneoNepalBhutanUganda and RwandaCambodiaTanzaniaAbout</p>\n\n<p>Like riding a bike- cow milking once learned is never forgotten</p>\n\n<p>My experience of culture shock started at an early age. When I was 9 years old my family moved from New York City to a very rural part of Ireland. As a New York kid in the 60’s we had TV, running water, electricity, a car- do you see where this is going?</p>\n\n<p>My parents, 4 siblings and I moved in with an ancient spinster aunt of my fathers. She lived in what had been a 4-room thatched cottage now with tin roof, pump in the yard for water, tilly lamp for light, open fire for cooking and an outside toilet that was frequently moved. It was a plank of wood with a hole cut in the centre over a hole. (The long drop is what they call it in Africa.) And despite what my brothers would tell you, I had to milk a cow every evening when I got home from school so that we had milk and we had to use the pump to provide all the water for us.</p>\n\n<p>So to call that culture shock is an understatement. No more rides to school- I was presented with a bike and told to ride 3 miles each way each day. Irish language was a compulsory subject so I was put into the baby class to learn it. And to top it all it was 1969, so the news was filled with the violence in the northern part of the country. But you know what, I survived. We built a modern house eventually and now that transition is part of the family lore.</p>\n\n<p>My next shock was moving back to the USA in 1981. I left the cosy confines of Dublin where I was very socially involved in current affairs and landed in Miami. Now that was a culture shock! No-one spoke English! In America! I nursed in Coral Gables for about a year and slowly became accustomed to patients not wearing pyjama tops (men) and divorcees (women). Divorce was still illegal in Ireland at this point as was homosexuality so both of these states were incredibly exotic to me. I moved from there to Tennessee, so you can see that I know a little about culture shock.</p>\n\n<p>This all brings me in a roundabout way to our EVA Travel give-back tours to Africa. I’ve wanted to come to Africa since I was about 16 years old and read a Mills and Boons book (Harlequin) about a nurse who comes to Africa, falls down the stairs of the plane, breaks her ankle and falls in love with the tall doctor with blue eyes. There’s the obligatory crisis but I’m pretty sure they got it together in the end. I had an incredibly romanticised view of the continent although the reality of poverty, political unrest and famine loomed large in my mind too.</p>\n\n<p>So my first trip to Uganda last year was a new, updated version of culture shock. Don’t get me wrong, I adore Africa but the rose tinted glasses need to come off. Many of the countries I’ve visited so far were all colonised and are only now starting to get to grips with the intricacies of independence. In Ireland we were luckier in that we had the EU to support our infrastructure but that is not yet widespread in Africa. There is a movement to create a Union of East African states to share a common currency, language, and trading arrangements but that’s still a long way off. The AU or African Union is another example of how the continent is beginning to get to grips with their combined challenges.</p>\n\n<p>For first timers, you’re much like me arriving in Abbeyleix in 1969. The electricity goes off when half your hair is dry, the lights disappear halfway through reading the menu, everything leaks and there’s a good chance you won’t get a shower every day. The mid-range hotels we use will not have a microwave in the room, there will not be a coffee maker and you’ll have to chase down a second towel. Oh and bring your own soap and shampoo.</p>\n\n<p>So its dusty- it’s Africa. That doesn’t mean it or the children are dirty or filthy, it just means you need to get used to the dust that gets into your crevices and stays there. So its bumpy- it’s called African massage. So your budget hotel doesn’t have Tom Cruise shaking cocktails- get a bottle of gin at the supermarket and shake your own. So there&#x27;s no hairdryer- no-one&#x27;s looking.</p>\n\n<p>There are shops and supermarkets so you can get whatever you feel you are missing when you get here, but you really need to come with an open mind for this type of affordable give-back travel. I cannot reconcile the idea of staying in 4 or 5 star accommodation, particularly while we&#x27;re on project and working with some of the poorest people on the planet. We promise you an authentic experience and that is what we deliver. It&#x27;s not all primitive, we definitely stay in some lovely places, but it&#x27;s nearly always mid-range.</p>\n\n<p>It takes a bit of adjustment to get used to Africa but everyone I know has loved it deeply and more than almost anywhere else, they always want to come back. So I would advise you to adjust your expectations just a little, read the packing hack and the packing list and come to Africa with an open heart as well. You’ll need it as you leave a little behind every time.</p>\n\n<p>LikeReplyann mccarthySep 14, 2025In my 50&#x27;s and early 60&#x27;s  I backpacked in about 50 different developing countries. (Wish I had known about volunteering and Give Back holidays then!) In 2004 I was offered a cheap  2 week return ticket from UK to Uganda when someone dropped out of a group tour. Like many others, something got to me in Uganda, and now in 2025 I have been back more than 50 times. I somehow managed to help locals build and open a school and medical centre and many other things you will take part in if you join Sheila&#x27;s new Rwanda/Uganda tour</p>\n\n<p>LikeReplySunny RaySep 12, 2025Setting expectations is key. Adapting when plans change is required. If participants can&#x27;t roll with the punches, maybe they ought to just book their own adventures! 😉</p>\n\n<p>LikeReplyPatSep 12, 2025Thank you Sheila - words can sometimes be worth a thousand pictures.</p>\n\n<p>LikeReplyAnitaSep 12, 2025Beautifully written you are such a great writer</p>"

I had been to visit the Batwa (pygmies) in Bwindi in March and was very taken by their story and plight. This tribe of indigenous people who were mainly hunter gatherers had been removed abruptly from the Impenetrable Forest as a result of government led conservation efforts and to protect the biodiversity and gorillas in the</p>\n\n<p>area. From what they told us, there was no plan to manage their removal- they had no homes, no land and they had to leave behind all their traditional ways of living. After several years of living on the streets and facing extreme poverty, the government stepped in and provided lands close to the Forest, but on the condition that they would never enter the Forest again.</p>\n\n<p>You can&#x27;t fix everything on a give back holiday but bringing a bit of joy can be wondrous and so I agreed. And so the problems started. I live in Northern Ireland and the football kit lived in England. No problem looking at it from Bwindi but slightly more of an issue from Belfast. This started my association with Kit Aid; a charity set up to send used football kits to Africa. Getting the kits anywhere was proving to be a problem!</p>\n\n<p>So I had the gear and assumed I was heading to the part of Bwindi we visited in March, a short walk down a rocky path. I just needed a driver to take us to the trading post. It was then I realised things were not going to be that simple. My phone was taken, examined and many African men and women started gesticulating, shouting and looking at me as if I was deranged. The fact that I probably am is beside the point.</p>\n\n<p>I was told that where I wanted to go was &#x27;very very far&#x27;. No problem, I would pay the 200 dollars to get us there. But I could not go alone. So we set off as a group of 4 women, 1 child and 3 men in a pretty crowded jeep. I should add it was Sunday so the ladies all had their Sunday shoes on and my friend Anita was in flip flops.</p>\n\n<p>The car journey was genuinely terrifying. Rockslides, potholes, missing bits of road and the overall African massage experience as we drove for 90 minutes to the area of Nkuringo. It felt great, we had arrived. But we hadn&#x27;t. We kept going through an even worse set of &#x27;roads&#x27; finally arriving at what people here call the end of the earth. And accurately so.</p>\n\n<p>The Batwa community leaders were there to greet us and we all shook hands and were delighted to see us. I handed over the suitcase and was ready to head back to the jeep when I realised we were not finished. We had to visit the community and it was a privilege to be invited to do so. It&#x27;s only 300 metres up that hill, we were told. Now I still work in feet and inches, so my rapid calculation told me we were good to go. I find this next bit hard to describe but can I just say that tracking gorillas was almost easier than our climb up that mountain. The suitcase was on someone&#x27;s head, the child was slung over someone&#x27;s shoulders and the Sunday church shoes would never look the same again. I still don&#x27;t know what 300 metres is but I suspect this was a lot more, on a narrow path and up an almost vertical mountain.</p>\n\n<p>But at last we arrived and the ceremony of delivering the kit started. I&#x27;m not really one for the limelight but as the honoured guest I had to give each man or child his shirt. They were really excited as I called out the name of the player on the back of each shirt and gave it to them which immediately was put on and paraded. We took pictures but nothing will ever fully capture the sheer excitement and delight of the team in receiving their kit. And some of the player names were very familiar leads to whoops and shouts of joy.</p>\n\n<p>After that we were treated to traditional Batwa dancing- a real joy to behold. Pictures just don&#x27;t do any of this justice- there we were at the end of the earth, high on top a mountain in the jungles of Bwindi like the last people left alive, nothing for miles around but jungle and the sounds of birds and Batwa.</p>\n\n<p>So that was the delivery of the Aston Villa football shirts, shorts and socks to the Batwa Pygmies of Bwindi Impenetrable Forest. They don&#x27;t have boots, but I did bring a football. Maybe next time? And there will be a next time, they&#x27;ve already made another application to Kit Aid. I just need to catch  breath.</p>"

I have accidentally set up a global travel business at the ripe old age of 65. In fact, I considered myself retired about 2 years ago and I was getting all the pieces in place. Joining a local class, reducing my outgoings, getting an armchair and knitting needles- you know the drill.But many of you will know that from late 2022 I had been helping people who had been impacted by the bankruptcy of We Are Bamboo, a seemingly wonderful eco-travel company that left thousands of customers out of pocket, some of them to the tune of thousands of dollars. As a certified money advice practitioner among other things, I was in a good place to set up templates and provide accurate advice on seeking refunds. I hadn&#x27;t lost very much money myself but I lost out on that part of my retirement dream. A holiday once a year to a developing country where I could join like minded travellers and give back over the course of 3 to 5 days.</p>\n\n<p>I&#x27;d been to Thailand, India and Costa Rica with Bamboo and I found this kind of travel to be transformative. The ability to work alongside local people on sustainability projects, watch turtles lay eggs in the shimmering moonlight of the Pacific Ocean and waddle off, yielding a machete in the jungles of the Myanmar border- all totally awesome experiences. I had never handled a machete before Thailand, but I consider myself quite competent with one now. These were holidays I never imagined I would take and experiences beyond my imagining. So for me the loss of Bamboo was not about the money, it was about the loss of a world I never thought I would glimpse.</p>\n\n<p>Holding an Apopo rat in Siem Reap, CambodiaIt&#x27;s been a bit of a journey over the last 3 years but helping people get their money back was definitely one of the more rewarding parts. When EVA started, I was just referring people to the operators who worked with Bamboo but I was afraid that without the proper financial controls there was really nothing in place to stop the same thing happening again. Regulations vary from country to country but the in UK/EU the laws state that anyone involved in selling or promoting tours must have adequate and appropriate financial cover. In many cases that can be ABTA or ABTOT, but as most of the  EVA community come from the USA, Canada and Australia we needed a more comprehensive solution.</p>\n\n<p>In 2025 I was introduced to Matt Fenton from Inspired Ventures, a man with endless patience and a deep knowledge about the travel business. So basically two of the things I lacked! At first the relationship simply helped me to provide the financial protection cover that I wanted to have for people, but as time went on it was clear that Matt shared the same vision for sustainable, ethical and give-back travel that I did. It&#x27;s a dangerous combination because every time we speak we add more projects and more destinations, but the EVA community have always had the last word in terms of where we go and what we do.</p>\n\n<p>In August 2025 we made our EVA/Inspired partnership more formal for a number of reasons. Whatever we are doing is working- people are loving this type of travel and we are doing a lot of good in many places. So at almost 66 I have to wonder- what if? What if I can&#x27;t do it anymore either through ill health or shuffling off the mortal coil. A succession plan was a key consideration so that the money, dreams and plans of the thousands of people in the EVA community will be assured into the future. The importance of having a good support team was also a big consideration- as we continue to grow people need good customer support and we have that with our Inspired partnership. And probably just the fact that working with Matt and the team at Inspired really helps make this a professional project but we still retain the ethos, the fun and the give back.</p>\n\n<p>So as I start packing for my longest trip away so far, I know that no matter what happens EVA Volunteer Travel is in a good place. We have a very active community on Facebook who keep me on the straight and narrow, we are venturing into Tik Tok and Instagram and we are adding at least 3 new tours in 2026 to join the 4 EVA tours that we already have. But more than anything else, I know that I can offer you a wonderful immersive holiday with financial protection and do so in a safe space.</p>\n\n<p>As always, you can contact me at any time either by emailing sheila@evatravel.uk or by using the contact form here on the website. And stay in touch to keep up to date with our exciting volunteer adventures!</p>"

        "content": "<p>BorneoNepalBhutanUganda and RwandaCambodiaTanzaniaAbout</p>\n\n<p>So someone asked me the other day if I was going to talk about landmines while here in Cambodia. I didn&#x27;t want to say too much until I knew if a meeting I was trying to arrange yesterday took place but it did, so now I can talk all day and all night about landmines!</p>\n\n<p>I mentioned earlier that on the day we visited the second temple at Angkor Wat, there was a group playing music. It took me a while to realise that they were all missing limbs and were victims of landmines. I wanted to learn more, as much as possible and explore any opportunities for volunteering or helping in some way.</p>\n\n<p>On Tuesday we went to visit the Apopo rats. I wouldn&#x27;t be a big fan of rats, in fact the opposite is true. My daughter once had 2 white pet rats and I couldn&#x27;t look at them or bear the idea that they slept in the same house as me. The idea that I would visit a rat house to look, never mind touch them was something way off my list. But there was a connection between rats and landmines, so I felt obliged to go see.</p>\n\n<p>So why the rats? What are landmines? Surely they&#x27;re all gone now and no-one would be that barbaric in this day and age to plant bombs that blow your legs off if you step on them, step over them or walk through a trip wire.</p>\n\n<p>Slowly I was learning that landmines are still a massive international issue. They&#x27;ve been laid during the Ukraine war, likely laid in Palestine and the estimate is that globally there are anything up to 110 million landmines buried in over 60 countries in the world. That&#x27;s stunning information.</p>\n\n<p>The Apopo centre shares 8 not-so-fun facts about landmines:</p>\n\n<p>They never expire, there are enough landmines laid to circle the earth twice, they&#x27;re cheap to make but expensive to remove, they are small in size but have an enormous impact, they are mainly designed to maim not kill, they injure around 6,000 people every year, they restrict economic growth in huge swathes of land around the world and they &#x27;turn every step into a gamble&#x27;.</p>\n\n<p>So back to Apopo. As mentioned above it costs a huge amount of money to remove landmines. Despite the best efforts of Princess Diana, people aren&#x27;t the best placed to detect them, dogs can be too heavy and age very quickly doing the work. Enter a Belgian man called Bart Weetjens in 1997 who was exploring methods for clearing landmines, read that gerbils had an acute sense of smell and wondered if his pet rat could learn to detect landmines.</p>\n\n<p>I mentioned my fascination with the rats and larger landmine issue to Dork Silong who promptly told me that I could meet Tun Channareth, known simply as Reth at the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) in Siem Reap along with Sister Denise. That&#x27;s a whole other story and worth having a google if you have any interest in this area of refugee work and displaced people.</p>\n\n<p>So anyway, yesterday I had the enormous privilege and honour of meeting Reth and Sr Denise at the JRS. I knew as she walked over to me that Sr Denise was something special, she looks just like my late beloved great-Aunt Sister Mary Dorothea and had the exact same manner. She&#x27;s a Mercy nun whereas I was a Sisters of Charity kind of girl, but she didn&#x27;t hold it against me. JRS is an oasis of beauty and calm that works with the ugliness and horror of war. In the middle of the garden is a pond which was formerly a crater caused by a bomb dropped by Americans during one of the many wars that have scarred South East Asia.</p>\n\n<p>Reth lost both his legs to a landmine and his story makes your heart do somersaults. He has suffered in unimaginable ways and he is open about the number of times he didn&#x27;t want to continue to live. But he has taken his tragedy and turned it into a life of goodness, kindness and purpose. He really is a legend.</p>\n\n<p>Reth and Sr Denise are part of an international campaign group that called for and drew up a treaty to stop the use of landmines. In 1997 Reth accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of the groups that were working to stop landmines. The work is by no means done- landmines are still being laid and only 160 countries have signed the Treaty. There&#x27;s a big list up on the wall of countries who have signed the Treaty on landmines, the Treaty against the use of nuclear weapons and pledge to support a sustainable future and I was very glad to see Ireland was up there and signed the Treaty but has not signed the ban on nuclear weapons.</p>\n\n<p>There&#x27;s a table filled with landmines and other ordanance including a cluster bomb filled with little bombs that kids think are balls and pick up getting blown to pieces.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#x27;t really get emotional during my visits, but there is something off the scale special about Sr Denise, Reth and the JRS. The rats are definitely heroes, but the past and present members of this organisation who have literally given the lives to help others during times of war and displacement are heroes of an entirely different order. No Peace Prize or award would ever be enough to reward them for their sacrifice and dedication.</p>\n\n<p>It goes without saying we will be visiting JRS next year if there&#x27;s a tour to Cambodia. We discussed what we might be able to do, so bringing a wheelchair to a victim of a landmine might be suitable as well as bringing rice to the families of victims.</p>\n\n<p>So that is nearly the end of my visit to Cambodia. I knew the bare bones of the history before I got here but nothing prepared me for the kindness of the people, the dedication of those making changes, the food, the Temples, the wildlife- well just about everything. Even if we don&#x27;t get enough people to join a tour next year, this is a country I have only just gotten to know and I will return. There&#x27;s work to be done!</p>"

So kudos to the brave souls who came with me on my new venture and faced quite a few challenges with good humour and great teamwork.</p>\n\n<p>One of the main challenges in Morocco was the weather. We arrived in the Zagora region about after severe flooding had damaged homes and 13 people lost their lives. When we talk about &#x27;damaged&#x27; homes, it doesn&#x27;t fully capture the devastation that was caused. I had been to Tagounite in March this year, so I was shocked to see parts of the main street simply washed away, the river now encroaching on homes and houses in ruins. During the week we were there, further rain and flooding occurred and it was like nothing I had ever seen. The evening before the rains we had spent in the desert making nomadic sand bread. The next morning, that entire desert area had become a lake as far as the eye could see. It hadn&#x27;t rained in the area for about 10 years so while you would imagine it might be welcome, ironically it challenges the eco-systems that have adapted to desert conditions. There was a fear that the palm trees would &#x27;drown&#x27;, given the amount of rain that was falling.</p>\n\n<p>Houses in that area are made from mud as it allows them to stay cooler in the very hot months. The downside is that there is no protection from this kind of occurrence and the mud simply washes away. In some areas where rebuilding is going on, the new structures are brick and concrete which may not be as cool but will withstand the deluges if they happen again.</p>\n\n<p>We have one place left on the September 14th 2025 tour to Morocco, but if there is sufficient interest we can certainly consider a further tour in October. There are going to be quite a few changes to the new itinerary and as soon as its finalised it will be published on the website for you to look at. We won&#x27;t return to Tagounite in 2025 for a variety of reasons but until we have a better idea of what weather changes are happening in the area and assess how safe it is, we will be working on projects close to Marakech in 2025. We will also return to the English Street Class which is a really marvellous project that I am so proud to support. I can&#x27;t wait to get stuck in, painting the walls and joining the english classes. We may be able to extend some of our volunteering in Essaouria to other projects and I&#x27;m working on that right now.</p>"

We wanted to encapsulate as much information as possible in our name and &#x27;ethical travel adventures&#x27; or EVA seemed to capture the essence of what we wanted to do.

How can you make sure a tour is ethical and why does it matter. I&#x27;ve long thought that for those of us over 45 particularly, there&#x27;s a special responsibility to travel in an ethical fashion. We are the generation who fared better than any in history in many ways but what are we leaving behind? And should we care?</p>\n\n<p>Children from the Moken Sea Gypsy tribe in ThailandSince the invention of the wheel, travel has been a source of joy, discovery, and connection. For many baby boomers- those of us born between 1946 and 1964- it represents a chance to explore new cultures, revisit cherished places, and create lasting memories. Yet, as awareness of environmental challenges grows, so does the sense of responsibility for the ecological damage caused by past and present human activities. Many boomers feel a personal connection to this issue, recognizing that their generation has witnessed significant environmental changes. This awareness fuels a desire to travel ethically and support sustainable practices that help repair some of the damage and raise awareness for future generations.</p>\n\n<p>Boomers grew up during a time of rapid industrial growth and globalization. This period brought unprecedented economic prosperity but also significant environmental costs. From deforestation and pollution to climate change and biodiversity loss, the impact of human activity became increasingly clear. Many boomers remember a world with cleaner air and water, more abundant wildlife, and less plastic waste. Single use plastic is a particular source of concern with oceans and landfills stuffed to the brim with plastic bottles and wrappings.</p>\n\n<p>Our generation often feels a unique responsibility because we have seen firsthand how the planet has changed. Importantly however, we also hold considerable influence as consumers, voters, travellers and community leaders. This combination of experience and influence creates an opportunity to lead by example in adopting more sustainable travel habits.</p>\n\n<p>Sustainable travel focuses on minimizing negative impacts on the environment, supporting local communities, and preserving cultural heritage. For boomers, this means making thoughtful choices that balance the joy of exploration with care for the planet.</p>\n\n<p>Key aspects of sustainable travel include:</p>\n\n<p>Choosing eco-friendly accommodations</p>\n\n<p>Looking for hotels or lodges that use renewable energy, reduce waste, and support conservation efforts. Many places now have certifications that verify their sustainability practices. When I&#x27;m booking for EVA Travel I try to avoid any hotels that use single use toothbrushes or toiletries, single use plastic water bottles and other items that fuel this problem</p>\n\n<p>Supporting local economies</p>\n\n<p>Buying from local artisans, eating at family-owned restaurants, and hiring local guides helps communities thrive and preserves cultural traditions. This is a key feature of EVA tours and our commitment to authentic travel benefits us as travellers as well as the communities we visit</p>\n\n<p>Reducing carbon footprint</p>\n\n<p>Opt for direct flights when possible, use public transportation, or explore destinations by walking or cycling. Some travelers also choose to offset their carbon emissions through verified programs and you can choose carbon off-set when booking with us. In Thailand last year, I visited a Mangrove Forest that was almost wholly supported by carbon offset financing. Known as &#x27;blue carbon sinks&#x27;, mangroves absorb ten times more carbon than terrestrial forests so you can see your commitment at work.</p>\n\n<p>Respecting wildlife and natural habitats</p>\n\n<p>Avoid activities that exploit animals or damage ecosystems. Instead, seek out responsible wildlife tours and protected areas that prioritize conservation. For EVA Travel, this is one of our most important tenets. We do not frequent any sanctuary or activity where the animals are in a confined area or allow holding for photographs,       riding, bathing, or hand feeding. Our focus is on conservation, protection and support in ethical ways.</p>\n\n<p>Carry reusable water bottles, bags, and utensils to reduce single-use plastics. You know the old adage- take only photos and leave only footprints. Any of us that have been involved in cleaning beaches are very much converted to minimizing waste!</p>\n\n<p>Kayaking in the Mangrove Forest near Koh SamuiHow Sustainable Travel Repairs Damage and Raises AwarenessEvery small action counts when it comes to healing the planet. Sustainable travel helps repair ecological damage by reducing pollution, conserving resources, and protecting habitats. For example, eco-friendly accommodations often invest in water-saving technologies and renewable energy, which lowers their environmental impact.</p>\n\n<p>Supporting local economies encourages communities to maintain their natural surroundings rather than exploiting them unsustainably. When travelers choose responsible wildlife tours, they contribute to conservation funding and discourage harmful practices like poaching or habitat destruction.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond direct environmental benefits, sustainable travel raises awareness and that is where I think EVA Travel can really make a difference. Even now I find myself talking about things I saw on my various trips and this awareness raising and ripple effect can lead to broader changes in attitudes and behaviors.</p>\n\n<p>Traveling with purpose requires planning and mindfulness. Here are some practical tips for those who want to make a positive impact:</p>\n\n<p>Plan your itinerary to reduce travel emissions</p>\n\n<p>Spend more time in fewer places to avoid frequent flights or long drives.</p>\n\n<p>Lighter luggage means less fuel consumption on planes and vehicles. It&#x27;s also a better way to travel but it does take a bit of time and experience to fully accept bringing less is more.</p>\n\n<p>Engage with local culture respectfully</p>\n\n<p>Learn about customs and traditions before you go, and always ask permission before photographing people or sacred sites. Check your EVA Vamoos for local information and key phrases and foods.</p>\n\n<p>Stay informed and share your knowledge</p>\n\n<p>Use your travel experiences to educate others about the importance of sustainable choices.</p>\n\n<p>Choosing EVA Travel means that we make every effort to make our tours ethical and sustainable. It&#x27;s not always the easiest thing to do as the message is slow to get accepted but we keep asking for changes to be made to accommodate us and try to illustrate how responsible travel is a win-win for all involved.</p>\n\n<p>Cleaning the beach on Rathlin Island, Northern IrelandMoving Forward with Purposeful TravelTravel offers a powerful way to connect with the world and contribute to its well-being. Us Boomers, with our life experience and values, are well-positioned to lead the shift toward more ethical and sustainable travel practices. By making informed choices, supporting local communities, and respecting nature, we can help repair some of the ecological damage and inspire others to follow.</p>\n\n<p>Your next trip can be more than just a vacation or holiday. It can be a step toward healing the planet and building a legacy of care for future generations. Traveling with purpose means embracing the joy of discovery while honoring the responsibility we share for the Earth.</p>\n\n<p>LikeReplyHelena4d agoA most insightful, encouraging, and informative blog.</p>\n\n<p>Congratulations, and thank you.</p>\n\n<p>Looking forward to the privilege of contributing to my next EVA travel experiences this year.</p>\n\n<p>LikeReplyCat4d agoSheila - A very thoughtfully worded post that is full of information and suggestions that are of utmost importance for this time in our history for planet Earth 🌍 and all of us who live on her, to guide us in making decisions that can keep her as healthy as possible and repair as much as we can of what has happened from we humans’ past “progresses”.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you go taking the time to compose this while I know you are always so busy and would probably just love to stop for a moment in time and put your feet up and have a cup a’ instead❣️</p>\n\n<p>LikeReplyDee4d agoDid I ever tell you , you&#x27;re my hero?</p>"

In the past and before online booking was available, booking months in advance was seen as a good way to save money and in most cases that was true.  However with the many changes in air travel over the past decade, those old rules no longer apply. I put some information together here for consideration. I already know people will disagree, but that&#x27;s ok. I just know that I booked a record number of flights for myself last year and many of them within a week or two  of travel. In fact I cancelled and rebooked one flight to Africa to save myself 800usd. So lets look at what the proven research can tell us.</p>\n\n<p>The Role of Flexibility in Finding Cheaper FlightsFlexibility is one of the most powerful tools for saving money on international flights. Being open to different travel dates, times, and even airports can make a significant difference.</p>\n\n<p>Booking international flights can feel like navigating a maze. You want the best price, but the rules about when to book and how to find deals seem confusing. Some say booking early saves money, others swear by last-minute deals. Some travelers use VPNs or incognito mode to get better prices. What really works? This post breaks down the facts about the best time to book international flights, how to use comparison websites effectively, and why certain popular tricks don’t actually help.</p>\n\n<p>Many travelers believe booking flights months in advance guarantees the lowest price. While early booking can sometimes help, it’s not always cheaper. Airlines adjust prices based on demand, season, and how close the flight date is.</p>\n\n<p>Booking international flights more than six months ahead often means paying a premium. Airlines release seats at higher prices initially, expecting business travelers or those with fixed schedules to pay more. Prices usually drop as the departure date approaches, especially during sales or when airlines want to fill seats.</p>\n\n<p>Research from travel experts and data analysis shows the best time to book international flights is typically 2 to 4 months before departure. This window balances availability and price drops. For example:</p>\n\n<p>For flights to Europe, booking around 3 months ahead often yields the best deals.</p>\n\n<p>For Asia or South America, 2 to 3 months before departure is ideal.</p>\n\n<p>Booking too close to the date (less than 2 weeks) usually means higher prices unless you find a last-minute sale.</p>\n\n<p>Prices also depend on the travel season and special events. Booking 3 months ahead for a trip during a major holiday or festival might not be enough. In those cases, booking earlier can secure a seat, but expect to pay more. Conversely, traveling in low season can mean better last-minute deals.</p>\n\n<p>Comparison websites are powerful tools for finding the best flight prices. They scan multiple airlines and booking platforms to show options side by side. But using them right is key.</p>\n\n<p>No single website covers every airline or route. Use at least 2 or 3 popular comparison sites like Skyscanner, Google Flights, and Kayak. This helps you spot price differences and find the best deal.</p>\n\n<p>Most comparison sites let you set alerts for specific routes and dates. This way, you get notified when prices drop or rise. It’s a smart way to monitor fares without constantly checking.</p>\n\n<p>Comparison tools often allow you to search for flights from nearby airports or with flexible travel dates. Sometimes flying from a different airport or shifting your trip by a day or two can save hundreds of dollars.</p>\n\n<p>Once you find a good deal on a comparison site, check the airline’s official website. Airlines sometimes offer the same or better prices directly and provide easier customer service if changes are needed.</p>\n\n<p>The idea that booking early always saves money is a myth. Airlines use dynamic pricing, which means prices change based on demand, competition, and how many seats are left. Here’s why early booking can backfire:</p>\n\n<p>Initial prices are often high to capture travelers who need to book far in advance.</p>\n\n<p>Airlines release discounted seats closer to departure to fill the plane.</p>\n\n<p>Booking too early locks you into a price that might drop later.</p>\n\n<p>For example, a traveler booking a flight from New York to Paris 9 months in advance might pay $1,200, while booking 3 months ahead could cost $900 for the same flight.</p>\n\n<p>Many travelers believe using a VPN or browsing in incognito mode hides their search history and can unlock lower prices. This is a common misconception.</p>\n\n<p>Prices are based on factors like demand, time, and seat availability, not your browsing history. There is no solid evidence that cookies or IP addresses influence flight prices.</p>\n\n<p>Multiple tests by travel experts show that prices remain the same whether you use a VPN, incognito mode, or clear cookies. Airlines want to sell seats, so they price tickets based on market conditions, not individual users.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of relying on VPNs or incognito mode, focus on:</p>\n\n<p>Using comparison websites to find the best deals.</p>\n\n<p>Setting price alerts.</p>\n\n<p>Being flexible with travel dates and airports.</p>\n\n<p>Booking during the optimal time window (2 to 4 months ahead).</p>\n\n<p>Start searching early but don’t book immediately. Track prices for a few weeks.</p>\n\n<p>Use multiple comparison sites to get a full picture of prices.</p>\n\n<p>Set up price alerts to catch drops.</p>\n\n<p>Be flexible with dates and airports.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid last-minute bookings unless you find a special sale.</p>\n\n<p>Check airline websites after finding deals on comparison sites.</p>\n\n<p>Ignore myths about VPNs and incognito mode affecting prices.</p>\n\n<p>Booking international flights doesn’t have to be confusing or expensive. The best time to book is usually 2 to 4 months before your trip, not too early and not too late. Use comparison websites wisely, set price alerts, and stay flexible with your plans. Avoid wasting time on myths like VPN tricks or incognito mode. Instead, focus on proven strategies to find the best price and enjoy your trip without stress.</p>"

        "content": "<p>BorneoNepalBhutanUganda and RwandaCambodiaTanzaniaAbout</p>\n\n<p>I&#x27;m in a lot of travel groups, many of them for over 50s but plenty of general groups as well. One of the most constant and recurring issues that arises in conversations is the relative merits or otherwise of group versus solo travel. And it&#x27;s a fascinating subject with no right or wrong answers. But I definitely have some opinions about who suits what kind of travel and the occasions when group travel is definitely for or not for you.</p>\n\n<p>When I think of solo travel, I think of it as making my own arrangements, staying on my own and visiting sites on my own. I&#x27;ve done this and to be very honest it is not for me. I had lunch with my ex-husband last week and it struck me that no matter what negativity went down, we had shared memories. We talked about things that happened in our past and it was fun that he remembered one part and I the other. So for me, solo travel  basically means not having someone to fill in the other bits with you.</p>\n\n<p>The advantages for some people are clear. You get to go where you want, when you want and by whatever means you choose. It&#x27;s a very independent way to travel and for some people it can lead to a big boost to their self confidence. But I remember last year being on Robben Island in Cape Town, feeling very moved by Nelson Mandela&#x27;s cell and his &#x27;garden&#x27;. The garden was little more than a patch of dry ground in the corner of a dusty yard, not anything like I had imagined. I felt the need to talk about this but everyone on the tour bus was with someone so I ended up talking to the tour guide. I&#x27;ve done some time as a Prison Visitor in Belfast, so I had an long chat with this poor unsuspecting man and shared my thoughts whether he wanted to hear them or not.</p>\n\n<p>There are measures you can take of course- read a book while having your meal, bring one of those handy- table taken cards with you, get a selfie stick or start a tour company so people will send you messages when you&#x27;re on the road. No- don&#x27;t do the last one, it&#x27;s taken.</p>\n\n<p>Safety is another issue for solo-solo travellers. Making sure that someone knows where you are at any given time and stays in regular contact. My children only know where I am now by reading my Facebook page, but I do try to update our family WhatsApp group every day when I&#x27;m away. If I know I will be out of signal I let them know that too. There are many other measures that people can take for safety such as locks for hotel doors, portable safes for your documents and money, safe bag for your belongings such as a pacsafe or bum bag/fanny pack. But your personal safety and protection of your documents as a solo traveller is paramount.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most important things is to be able to say no and mean it. I was in Istanbul once for a sailing course long before I started really travelling and knowing the ropes. A very lovely man offered to help me find the Blue Mosque (it was hard to miss) and then offered to bring me to his uncle&#x27;s carpet store. I was a bit unsure but didn&#x27;t want to offend him. But as we descended 4 flights of stairs into a basement in the heart of Istanbul I became very unsure. I drank the obligatory mint tea and despite all the sob stories was able to leave without buying a very precious, unique, hand made from fairy eyelashes carpet. It was hairy and I know better now, but NO is a really important word and having the confidence to say it and mean it.</p>\n\n<p>But what about Group Travel? Either as a solo traveller in a group or with someone you know. Well I&#x27;ve done both of those too and there are pitfalls of course as well as advantages. On the negative side, if you&#x27;re with a large commercial company group you are very much on a conveyor belt. Your time is all laid out and very often anything off the itinerary has to be paid for and that makes a cheap holiday look a lot more expensive. My worst experience was going to Mallorca one year, after the eco-company Bamboo folded with a Meet-Up group from Belfast. I did my best to fit in as a solo there but the group were drinking the free beer from 8 in the morning until 4am every day. I know I participated in a Karaoke session in Magaluf one of the nights, but that&#x27;s peer pressure! I spent most of the time on my own in the end visiting beaches and churches- something that didn&#x27;t interest anyone else.</p>\n\n<p>The good part of a group trip of course is that you have safety, someone to eat with, share photos with and chat with. The days are laid out and you have someone to help you plan if you need to break away. A group is more important in a destination that you are completely unfamiliar with or if there are any safety concerns. You&#x27;ll have the protection of a tour leader and their back up team who can take action in emergency situations, like flooding in the Sahara Desert! A story for another day.</p>\n\n<p>So how can or do you choose the ideal group? Well start by thinking of what&#x27;s important to you, where you want to go and who your ideal travel companions would be. Naturally I&#x27;m going to talk about EVA Travel here because if you&#x27;re the right fit we&#x27;re a wonderful way to travel. We are a community and we are mainly like-minded people who want to give a little back to make a difference to the places we visit.</p>\n\n<p>Give back is at the heart of what we do but I&#x27;ve also tried really hard to make sure you experience the very best of the country you are visiting. I like to try and get behind the scenes and off the tourist trail. It&#x27;s not always possible, but on the Northern Ireland tour we avoided big breweries and distilleries, instead learning about Guinness in a quaint local pub and pouring pints. We learned about whiskey and gin while making organic chocolate treats and got to hang with the locals on Rathlin Island to see the Jumplings on the wild and rugged Atlantic Coast.</p>\n\n<p>But managing expectations in any kind of group is the key. Travelling to parts of Africa can be very challenging and you must accept that the standard of accommodation and transport is likely not what you would be used to at home. If you&#x27;re flexible, adaptable and fun- you&#x27;ll do just fine with an EVA trip. For me the best part of the EVA tours is that we can be as flexible as we please. If the group decides they want a late start, we can move things around very easily. Another day at Angkor Wat? No problem, we&#x27;ll get that sorted.</p>\n\n<p>Group travel is not for everyone, but if you are looking for a community experience, lots of laughter and the beginnings of a lifelong friendship, then look no further- you&#x27;ll find a welcome waiting for you here.</p>\n\n<p>I relate well with all of your comments and, through my travel experiences, particularly with EVA Travel, totally agree with your last paragraph.</p>\n\n<p>It&#x27;s perhaps helpful to realise that &#x27;the good old days&#x27; are being created by what we choose to be doing now.</p>\n\n<p>Supported ethical group travel, contributing to welcoming and diverse communities, learning about other cultures, and happily sharing it all daily with other like-minded people is a wonderful privilege, and even more so when memories of these special times are reminisced in the future by the participants who have become travel friends.</p>"

        "content": "<p>BorneoNepalBhutanUganda and RwandaCambodiaTanzaniaAbout</p>\n\n<p>And of course that got me thinking: what are the barriers for older women or indeed men who want to travel the world. Because I hear it all the time, someone needs &#x27;to work&#x27; on someone else to persuade them its ok to travel, people talk to me before booking to discuss their fears or I can read it on the Facebook page and hear the anxiety that&#x27;s generated. I remember exactly how I felt before my first give back tour to Thailand in 2018- a true mixture of deep fear but also a sense of escape.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to deciding to travel I had been single for about 10 years and in a relationship with a chap for about 6 months. Actually, I used to have a date once a year prior to that to prove that it was still possible. Some of the dates lasted less than 30 minutes, the longest was about 3 months. I joke about writing a book about it and I&#x27;ve given nicknames to all the men- from the Biker, the Captain, the Pilot, the Vicar, the Artist, the Chicken Whisperer and you get the drift. This last one was The Swindler and I was giving serious thought to wrapping things up when he told me he didn&#x27;t want to see me anymore. Fair enough, I had told him I wasn&#x27;t going to give him any more money so it was bound to happen.</p>\n\n<p>On the night this happened, I was going to drive home from his house- about 45 minutes away. But as I stepped out the door I could see a ferocious storm was brewing. It was known as Storm Finn and had a devastating impact in Ireland that year. I turned back and said to the Swindler, I can&#x27;t drive in that it&#x27;s not safe. He just looked and said &#x27;well you can&#x27;t stay here&#x27;. Again I repeated that it wasn&#x27;t safe and he told me I was welcome to sleep in the attic with the mice.</p>\n\n<p>I headed out to drive home and as I turned the corner I saw something snap and spark. I could see clearly that an electricity wire had snapped and my car was now between 2 pieces of line swaying up and down in the storm. I couldn&#x27;t drive forward or back, couldn&#x27;t get out of the car so I phoned 999 and explained the situation. They assured me someone would be sent out as soon as possible but to remain in the car. And to remain on the line. It was that reassuring comment and eerily calm voice that worried me and I joked &#x27;you make it sound like I should record goodbye messages to my family&#x27;! And of course I&#x27;ll never forget the response, &#x27;it wouldn&#x27;t be the worst idea&#x27;. Long story short, help arrived, I was rescued and it took about 3 hours to drive home in those atrocious conditions.</p>\n\n<p>The next morning I woke and made a vow. I was going to die single. 10 years of fruitless chasing for a decent relationship had ended as far as I was concerned and I was content with my decision. For a few hours anyway then I found myself googling- what should I do with myself aged 58 if I want to enjoy my remaining years of life. And immediately google knew what to do. Join the Bam Fam, it told me- travel the world and give back meaningfully. Now I love google but I didn&#x27;t book a ticket there and then. No siree, as someone who had only ventured to France and Spain with visits to family in America the thought of going to the Far East or anything more east than London was unfathomable. So I researched and researched this company who offered trips to people who were Young at Heart. I finally met someone who had been on a trip and spoke very highly of them, so I booked the trip.</p>\n\n<p>It seemed like an enormous amount of money to me, but I could pay in instalments. I was going to Thailand. In a million years before that I could never have imagined going to Thailand, it was so exotic, so foreign and oh my goodness, what would the neighbours think.  Anyway, me being me, I set out to learn all I could about what to expect both by reading but spending endless hours in our local Thai restaurants trying out food and learning about what to expect. Booked a flight, packed almost all my worldly possessions including kettle, fan, biscuits, pillow and enough clothes for several holidays, checked my Will and waited for the big day to arrive. When I look back now I can laugh- I was so over prepared and the anxiety levels were massive.</p>\n\n<p>But I soon met the other girls on the trip and slowly we started to bond. As with many groups, not everyone was ever going to get on but our lovely Jai helped with that and smoothed over any difficulties. But the bit I remember the most about Thailand was the volunteering both at the elephant sanctuary but also up with the Lahu tribe in their coffee plantation. It&#x27;s hard to describe how different this was to my real life and I loved every  minute of it. As someone who was tied to a desk during the week, getting out and swinging a machete or sitting in a mud trench planting coffee was truly liberating. I didn&#x27;t know any better at the time,  but hand feeding elephants and bathing in a mud hole with them was all part of the wonder of this trip.</p>\n\n<p>In some ways the rest is history and I wrote about it in August last year, but to quickly recap, I went to India in 2019, lost my trip in 2020 to Uganda due to covid but by 2022 I was back on the road to Costa Rica for another incredible experience in that vibrant country doing night watch with turtles. I was so very hooked on this kind of travel, so much so that when the original company went out of business I tried to keep the ethos alive and ultimately set up EVA Volunteer Travel.</p>\n\n<p>No matter what people say about it, we make a difference. I remember being in a remote area of Ethiopia last year with a very primitive tribe in the mountains and the Village Elder said to me as I was leaving &#x27;Even if you never come back here, it has meant the world to us that you came to visit and cared&#x27;.</p>\n\n<p>So am I still scared or fearful? Oh no, that ship has sailed twice around the world. I honestly and genuinely embrace it all. The rough lodges interspersed with amazing hotels, rough roads, rocky boats, unfamiliar food and drink, lack of sleep on long flights, quad bikes, camel rides, beggars both simple and sophisticated- I love it all. Once I took that first leap and went to Thailand, the world became my oyster. I have made friends all  over the world but more importantly I now help people to enjoy these experiences too and make a difference everywhere we go. It may seem like a small difference to someone who has everything in the Western world, but to a small child in Uganda a toy car becomes the most precious possession and a set of reusable menstrual pads means a girl in Tanzania can go to school all the days of the month.</p>\n\n<p>So feel the fear and travel anyway, there&#x27;s a whole world out there waiting for you and thousands of like minded strangers just waiting to be your friends.</p>"
